# Task_4-Submission
Use SQL queries to extract and analyze data from a database.  

# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using Structured Query Language (SQL).
It provides detailed insights into order patterns, revenue generation, popular pizza types, and customer purchasing trends.

The goal is to answer critical business questions such as total sales, best-selling pizzas, and revenue contribution by category — turning raw data into actionable insights. 

# Objectives

Retrieve total number of pizza orders.
Calculate total revenue from pizza sales.
Identify highest-priced pizzas and most ordered types.
Analyze order distribution by hour, date, and category.
Determine top-performing pizza types by revenue.
Find percentage contribution of each pizza to overall revenue.
Analyze cumulative revenue growth over time. 

# Dataset Information:

The dataset consists of four main tables:

orders – stores order details (order ID, date, time)
orders_details – contains order line items (pizza ID, quantity)
pizzas – information about pizzas (pizza ID, type ID, size, price)
pizza_types – pizza type details (name, category, ingredients)  

# Tools & Technologies:

MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server – database for analysis
SQL – querying and analysis
GitHub – version control and portfolio showcase 
PowerPoint – for visual presentation of SQL findings
